# BBS Mixer

A simple mixer using web audio. See the [demo](https://mixer.musicpracticetools.net).

Open a directory and each audio file becomes a mixer channel strip to manage that file. Press play or pause.

Just faders, mute and solo for each channel. Plus a master channel with mute and solo clear buttons, with its own mute.

On of the growing collection of [musicpracticetools.net](https://musicpracticetools.net) music companion web apps.

Built with open source love by Steve Lee using [sveltkit](https://kit.svelte.dev) and deployed on [netlify](https://app.netlify.com/).
